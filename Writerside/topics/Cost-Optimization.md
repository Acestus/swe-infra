# Cost Optimization

I can optimize costs by collecting data and setting up guardrails.
I use Azure Cost Management to analyze and visualize costs.
I can set up budgets and alerts to notify when spending exceeds a certain threshold.
I review Azure Advisor to get recommendations on how to optimize costs.
I configure Azure Policy to enforce policies that help control costs.
